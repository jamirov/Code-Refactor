# Code-Refactor

Changes I have made in HTML:

1. Changed the title from Wesite to Horiseon
2. Added an id element to div so search engine optimization so all links work.
3. Replaced div with class="header" with header tag.
4. Replaced the div element with footer class to the <footer> tag.



Chages I have made in CSS: (style.css had a 200 lines of styling and now it is 122 rows. )


1. Removed class and span tags from H1 (Horison) and put all in <h1> tag.

3. Removed css: copied and pasted list style type and pasted to header div ul li
list-style-type: none;

4. .benefit-brand , befint cost and benefit lead  img 's  all styled under one selector . beefits.img.
5. benefits 3 divs also merged into one style with .benefits div selector
6. benefit h3 style also merged into one .benefits div h3 selector.
7. Styles under content class are all 3 duplicates has been merged into one.
8. Replaced the footer class selectors with footer tag selectors.
